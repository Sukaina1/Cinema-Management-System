**Introduction:**

For thousands of people outing to the cinema is definitely the best way to spend leisure-time, meet with friends or have fun with family. Today there is a wide range of cinemas, movies and film shows for any taste and budget. To enjoy your outing, you have to find the film you want then find the cinema that's showing it, check the times, buy the tickets. Agree, it takes a lot of time and efforts. And here comes our Cinema Management System.

**Working:**

SQL Server along with C# was used to create this project. The desktop application starts to run when the Loading page appears on the screen. Once it is loaded, Login page is displayed where the user adds the username and password to login into the application. If wrong username or password is entered, the user is informed via message box. Next, the Menu page is shown, giving the user four options: movies, audience, ticket, and cancellation. The user can then proceed accordingly.
